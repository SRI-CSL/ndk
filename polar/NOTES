Polar device will work with this code on Mac OSX, but you need to use
a UUID and not a MAC address on MacOS.

Suggest you copy main.py and create a new version that just records
data to file.

ECG looks decent, but timestamp is unclear.  Is it ticks of 1/130
second?  I am pretty sure that this is the case.

05/08/2023: Time to think about event-gated stimulus.  We will have to
define short packets that are delivered in response to external
events.  Here are fun event categories:

1) R peak referenced phases of the cardiac cycle (R plus time offset)
2) Phase of respiration
3) Cue presentation
4) Reward presentation

How to do this?  First, define the stimlet to be used.  This is a
short-duration .ss program.  If the .ss program is longer than the
cycle in question, we simply play it anyway and gate on the next
"available" event.

Precompute all packets by converting the .ss files to waveforms that
can be delivered as soon as the event is flagged.

Event detection: For cardiac and respiration, we need to rely on the
incoming cardiac or respiration pulse.  This means that we will need
to find peaks perhaps by thresholding the appropriate component, and
then deliver the stim at some offset after that event.

For behavioral events (cues, rewards) we will need some external
marker.  For motor acts, we can use accelerometers.  For visual cues,
we could, for example, sync with display devices.
